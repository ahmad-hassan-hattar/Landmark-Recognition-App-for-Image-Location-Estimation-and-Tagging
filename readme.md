# Landmark Classifier Project

## Project Overview
Welcome to the Landmark Classifier project! In this project, I have applied the skills acquired during the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) course to build a landmark classifier.

With the proliferation of photo sharing and storage services, having location data for each uploaded photo has become essential. This location data enables these services to offer advanced features like automatic tag suggestions and organized photo collections, enhancing the overall user experience. However, a significant number of photos lack location metadata, either because the capturing device lacks GPS capabilities or due to privacy concerns leading to metadata removal.

When location metadata is absent, one approach to infer the location is by detecting and classifying discernible landmarks within the image. Given the sheer volume of images and landmarks worldwide, manual classification becomes impractical. This project takes the initial steps towards tackling this challenge by developing models capable of predicting image locations based on depicted landmarks. 

Throughout the project, I have meticulously followed the machine learning design process. This includes data preprocessing, the design and training of various CNN models, accuracy comparison among these models, and finally, deploying an application based on the most successful CNN architecture.

## Project Details
Here are the key steps and components of the completed project:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: I've carefully prepared the dataset by performing necessary preprocessing tasks. This ensures that the data is appropriately formatted, cleaned, and ready for training.

2. **CNN Design and Training**: I've designed and trained several Convolutional Neural Network models. These models have been trained on the prepared dataset to learn and recognize landmarks in images.

3. **Accuracy Comparison**: To determine the most effective CNN architecture, I've thoroughly evaluated the accuracy of each trained model. This process involved validating the models against various metrics to select the best performer.

4. **App Deployment**: The CNN model that achieved the highest accuracy has been integrated into an application. This application allows users to upload images, which are then processed by the model to predict the depicted landmark's location.
